Follow these simple steps to build VHPOP:

  ./configure [options]
  make

For brief information on how to run VHPOP, use the following command:

  ./vhpop --help

If you are unable to build VHPOP, please report your problems to
<lorens@cs.cmu.edu>.

**NOTE**: These instructions are kept around for future modification - I do not think they will work for Recurve.
